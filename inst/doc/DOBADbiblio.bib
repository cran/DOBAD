abstract = {Motivation: The Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm, in the form of the Baum-Welch algorithm (for hidden {M}arkov models) or the Inside-Outside algorithm (for stochastic context-free grammars), is a powerful way to estimate the parameters of stochastic grammars for biological sequence analysis. To use this algorithm for multiple-sequence evolutionary modelling, it would be useful to apply the EM algorithm to estimate not only the probability parameters of the stochastic grammar, but also the instantaneous mutation rates of the underlying evolutionary model (to facilitate the development of stochastic grammars based on phylogenetic trees, also known as Statistical Alignment). Recently, we showed how to do this for the point substitution component of the evolutionary process; here, we extend these results to the indel process.  Results: We present an algorithm for maximum-likelihood estimation of insertion and deletion rates from multiple sequence alignments, using EM, under the single-residue indel model owing to Thorne, Kishino and Felsenstein (the  TKF91' model). The algorithm converges extremely rapidly, gives accurate results on simulated data that are an improvement over parsimonious estimates (which are shown to underestimate the true indel rate), and gives plausible results on experimental data (coronavirus envelope domains). Owing to the algorithm's close similarity to the Baum-Welch algorithm for training hidden {M}arkov models, it can be used in an  unsupervised' fashion to estimate rates for unaligned sequences, or estimate several sets of rates for sequences with heterogenous rates.  Availability: Software implementing the algorithm and the benchmark is available under GPL from http://www.biowiki.org/  Contact: ihh@berkeley.edu

We observe progenitor cells in samples of bone marrow taken from hybrid cats whose cells contain a natural binary marker. With data consisting of the changing proportions of this binary marker over time from several cats, estimates for stem cell self-renewal and differentiation parameters are obtained using an estimating equations approach.},

They have therefore not been available for application to Bayesian model determination, where the dimensionality of the parameter vector is typically not fixed. This paper proposes a new framework for the construction of reversible Markov chain samplers that jump between parameter subspaces of differing dimensionality, which is flexible and entirely constructive. It should therefore have wide applicability in model determination problems. The methodology is illustrated with applications to multiple change-point analysis in one and two dimensions, and to a Bayesian comparison of binomial experiments.

The present paper introduces a gradient algorithm that is closely related to the EM algorithm. This EM gradient algorithm approximately solves the M-step of the EM algorithm by one iteration of Newton's method. Since Newton's method converges quickly, the local properties of the EM gradient algorithm are almost identical with those of the EM algorithm. Any strict local maximum point of the observed likelihood locally attracts the EM and EM gradient algorithm at the same rate of convergence, and near the maximum point the EM gradient algorithm always produces an increase in the likelihood. With proper modification the EM gradient algorithm also exhibits global convergence properties that are similar to those of the EM algorithm. Our proof of global convergence applies and improves existing theory for the EM algorithm. These theoretical points are reinforced by a discussion of three realistic examples illustrating how the EM gradient algorithm can succeed where the EM algorithm is intractable.},

Genotyping was performed to identify clustered cases.<P></P>RESULTS: The annual TB case rate decreased significantly from 50.8 to 28.8 cases/100000 persons from 1992 to 1999 (<I>P</I> &#60; 0.0001). After 1999, no significant decrease was observed for the population as a whole or in any subgroup examined. Similarly, the rate of clustered cases decreased significantly from 1992 to 1999 (11.4 to 3.1 cases/100000, <I>P</I> &#60; 0.0001). Although the rate of non-clustered cases also declined significantly (25.6 to 17.6 cases/100000, <I>P</I> &#60; 0.0001), there was a disproportionate reduction in clustered cases (94.7% vs. 50.8%, <I>P</I> &#60; 0.0001). Neither clustered nor non-clustered cases decreased significantly after 1999.<P></P>CONCLUSIONS: TB case rates reached a plateau despite ongoing application of control measures implemented in 1993. These data suggest that intensification of measures designed to identify and treat persons with latent TB infection will be necessary to further reduce TB incidence.",
